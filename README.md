# Introduction

Our game is a 2D platform game which, like other similar 2D platforms, allows for a character to jump through obstacles, avoiding enemies and collecting points. 

<br>
<p align="center">
 <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/104866923/aef13f50-98de-417a-aa9f-402e4b209f9c" alt="Enemies Chase Mechanics" style="width:100%; height:350px;">
 <p align="center">Enemies Chase Mechanics </p>
</p>

<br>

The added twist within our game is the addition of a timed flying mechanic. This ‘power-up’ allows the player to fly for a short period of time, making traversal through the game world easier.

</p>

<br>
<br>

Early on the inspiration for our game was the fondness all team members had towards games like Super Mario, we chose this because it also gave a simple vision to consitantly aim for in the game development process. This was reflected in our initial idea for the game where the twist would be that princess peach would be rescuing Mario. Over time however this evolved, as we sought after our own story line and unique game aesthetic.

# Requirements

 **ideation, Use-cases and User Stories**

Our group first came up with six game ideas, these were narrowed down to two potential games that looked the most promising. The games that we selected were : 

- 2D Platform. Inspired by Mario, with a twist that would allow the user to control the player in the same manner as seen in flappy bird (each press of a key will elevate the player in space, keeping the player afloat)
- Temple Run: Similar to the 2D platform game idea, however the the camera would follow the player as you traversed through the map. The twist for this game would be that the screen would shrink as the game progressed, closing centrally onto the character, meaning that there was a inherit time limit within which the user had to complete the map.

For both these games, we identified the stakeholders, user stories and the potential challenges, we then prepared our paper mock ups, divieing up the task within the group. We used the paper prototypes to visualise how the main game screen would look and to work out the aesthetics of the game.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/104866923/4d2145e1-922c-4c5d-ac44-03e8053819c4" alt="Game Preview" style="width:100%; height:350px;">
</p>

<br>
<br>

**Identifying the stakeholders**

We identified the *primary stakeholders* for the game are the individuals who will be directly playing the game and reviewing it, these are: 

- Friend and Family / Other teams within our cohort : As the ones testing and playing, students within our cohort as well as friends and family members have a direct stake in the games success making them the operational support within the onion diagram shown below
- Lecturers / Markers / TAs : As the game is part of an educational goal, the game will be reviewed and tested thus making the educational support staff / Lecturers functional beneficiaries and sponsors of the game.

<br>
<br>

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/153836423/c9d2c6e1-9805-42d4-b642-737598cf019c" alt="Game Preview" style="width:70%; height:70%;">
</p>

The interaction of the stake holders with this game is designed to be identical so the user specification and user stories can be condensed for all stake holders identified above.

**User Case Story**

- Control the player / character via intuitive controls
- Have clear objectives and goals that the user must achieve when playing the game, i.e. a clear incentive
- Have special power ups and milestones

# Implementation
  
  Our game features an intricate system centered around the creation of "AnimatedSprite," a class housing the base character animations responsible for loading and executing various actions. Built upon this foundation, we implement the attributes of the player character, enhancing their functionality atop the AnimatedSprite framework. The core logic governing the behavior of boss characters takes precedence in our game, encompassing elements such as damage calculation, pursuit tactics, movement speed, and engagement range. Notably, classes like "PumpkinMonster," "RedSmile," and "RedSprite" derive from the original Boss class, loading distinct actions to diversify gameplay.

  To orchestrate the game's mechanics and level progression, we utilize the "Game" class for initializing maps, characters, and classes, while employing "Map" to dynamically generate environments and adversaries. Meanwhile, "PlayPage" facilitates seamless transitions between various game states, encompassing the start screen, end screen, and leaderboard interfaces. Additionally, the "Movement" class governs character movement logic and key mappings, ensuring fluid player control.
  
  Throughout the development journey, we encountered a myriad of challenges, ranging from optimizing character animations to managing the intricacies of boss logic and crafting dynamic game maps. Moreover, implementing interactions between players and enemies presented its own set of obstacles. In our pursuit of refining the game's quality and enhancing user experience, we'll delve into the specific challenges encountered and detail our strategies for overcoming them, ultimately fortifying our game development process.

### Challenge 1

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/3e9419ed-ddfd-4bda-b8e3-0edfd9584fbc" alt="image" style="width:50%; height:350px;"
</p>
 
   <br>
   During our development process, we encountered a challenge related to preserving the correct game state after a character's death and game restart. Specifically, utilizing the gw.create() method post-character death and subsequent game restart failed to maintain the intended game state. Despite collecting crucial elements like a pumpkin before the character's demise, certain elements were not retained upon game restart. This issue led to an accumulation of items and an abrupt termination of the game due to inadvertent duplication of item quantities.

### Solution 1

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/ddd64f74-2bbf-4304-aae7-6a042c41678e" alt="image" style="width:50%; height:350px;"
</p>

  <br>
  To tackle this dilemma effectively, we implemented a solution that involved resetting all monster lists and character information within the gameworld object. By doing so, we ensured that the game starts afresh with the accurate state upon each restart, thereby mitigating the risk of unintended item duplication and ensuring a smoother gameplay experience.


### Challenge 2
 

https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/abd8852b-c5f1-4ab5-a410-7d6410769a34


 <br>
 In our game, when the difficulty level is set to "Hard," enemy behavior involves calculating the distance between enemies and the player. However, a critical flaw in our collision detection logic causes enemies to inaccurately perceive the player's position. As a result, they mistakenly believe they've collided with the player, particularly when the player is positioned above a brick (as depicted in the provided video). This erroneous perception leads enemies to cease their pursuit, disrupting the intended gameplay flow.

 ### Solution 2

 <img width="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/2e174034-ea3a-4e1b-991f-ef2bbfc914c2">

  <br>
  To swiftly address this issue while prioritizing efficiency, we opted for a pragmatic solution rather than investing extensive resources into modifying the complex collision detection mechanism. Our chosen approach involves elevating the brick, thereby increasing the distance between the player and enemies. By implementing this adjustment, we effectively mitigate the impact of the collision detection error. Enemies are less likely to mistakenly converge on the brick, ensuring that their behavior aligns more closely with the intended gameplay dynamics.


 ### Challenge 3

 
https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/5a63dd63-a483-40c9-b062-e0e5ffc15c88


 <img width="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/0ee6c46c-8637-464d-a253-9cddecd35d45">

<img width="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/a863099f-5610-4ebe-b03b-78baca5646c1">

<br>
  During gameplay, clicking on the leaderboard button consistently triggered a sudden switch to a new game, preventing players from accessing the leaderboard in time. This issue arose because the restart button shared the same location as the leaderboard button. Consequently, double-clicking on the leaderboard button often inadvertently activated the restart button, leading to unintended game restarts.


 ### Solution 3

 <img width="416" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/ea0d3f47-3155-4c5c-adb2-b5beb88b158c">

  To address this usability issue and improve player experience, we relocated the restart button to a different position. By separating the restart button from the leaderboard button, we reduced the likelihood of accidental activations during interactions with the leaderboard interface. This adjustment aimed to minimize player frustration and ensure that accessing the leaderboard remained a smooth and uninterrupted experience.

   ### Challenge 4

   During the development phase, we encountered a significant challenge related to the character's collision box, which was oversized. This discrepancy caused the character to appear suspended above the ground rather than properly grounded. Additionally, when the character flipped, improper collision positioning resulted in a subtle yet noticeable displacement of the character's image. Upon investigation, we identified that transparent pixels within the character's image were causing issues in collision detection. These transparent pixels inadvertently triggered collisions prematurely, especially when the character approached a wall or obstacle.

  ### Solution 4
  
  <img width="248" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/3e8684fa-7c51-4553-9ebb-76d5cac27e30">
  <img width="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/126887318/a1816845-5c2d-4249-8eb0-e55e2de63e70">

<br>
To address this issue effectively, we implemented a transparent pixel cropping technique on the character's image. This process involved trimming away the transparent pixels surrounding the character's visible portions, ensuring that the collision box accurately represented the character's silhouette. By restricting the collision box to encompass only the visible areas of the character, we significantly enhanced the accuracy of collision detection.



# Evaluation

 Evaluation is fundamental in software development as it enables developers to analyse and refine the software to meet users’ requirements effectively. To ensure that our project meets users’ requirements, our group implemented two evaluation measures: qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Any issues identified from these evaluations, if applicable, were addressed and some evaluations were run multiple times to better evaluate the project.

 Our game’s main objective could be summarised as below:
-	Collect as much as pumpkins.
-	Go as far as you can.

 Given the tasks, for qualitative evaluation, two methods were introduced: Think Aloud and Heuristics Evaluation. Think Aloud evaluation requires users to verbalise their thoughts and impressions while performing the requested tasks. Such verbalised thoughts are highly associated with the user’s experience and addressing these potential issues or bugs pointed out by the participants is essential to ensure the quality of a developing software is consistent and reliable. 
 
 The below represents the results from the Think Aloud evaluation of the prototype game.  The game was run on the test map and with test features. Two participants, one facilitator and two observers joined the evaluation and the issues identified during the evaluation were then addressed to improve the real game. The collected data were then processed into customised categories: “Nothing to be addressed”, “Issues to be addressed”, “Issues to be discussed”, and “Uncertain”. The first two categories identify data that their names clearly suggests while the “Issues to be discussed” identifies issues that is worth discussing at a group level since this could be viewed as a bug or perhaps the game developers’ (our) intention. Lastly, the last category identifies data that could not be interpreted. 

### Think Aloud (Raw) ###

 Two more participants joined the same evaluation after Easter holiday right after the real game features and the two difficulty levels were finally introduced into out project. Its following results are presented underneath in the same style as above.

</p>

 For better analysis, Heuristic Evaluation was also conducted as well. The below results represent the Heuristic Evaluation. Overall, qualitative evaluations in which Think Aloud combined with Heuristic Evaluation may have proposed what could be better improved in the context of developing a user friendly software (game).

<p align="center">

</p>

 For quantitative evaluation, NASA TLX have been implemented to evaluate the perceived difference of the two game levels, namely “easy” and “hard”, and these results then have been analysed in the context of W test statistic. NASA TLX is one of the most widely used tool to measure the subjective workload perceived by the users and it is used across various industries including software engineering, health, and so on. It specifically, measures the multidimensional workload from executing a specific requested task and these dimensions are comprised of Mental Demand, Physical Demand, Temporal Demand, Performance, Effort, and Frustration. The detailed explanation of these components is provided underneath.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/UoB-COMSM0110/2024-group-12/assets/104866923/1efd47bf-f9ba-442f-8391-1df371fd77e5" style="width:70%; height:70%;">
</p>

 The overall derived results and its subscale measures from NASA TLX is valid as demonstrated from significant independent research. Considering all these, NASA TLX appeared to be the most appropriate quantitative method to evaluate the designed level systems, “easy” and “hard”, in the game.  

 For the evaluation, 10 participants (N=10) were recruited. The participants were then requested to play the designed two different levels (easy, hard) of the game with the required task. All participants first played the “easy” level then played the “hard” level. After the completion, the same participants were asked to finish the NASA TLX. It is worth noting that there could have been a training effect where a participant after finishing the “easy” level had higher chance of better performing at the “hard” level, implying that there could have been a plausible bias for participants to underestimate the “hard” level. However, due to the difficulty in recruiting participants, the evaluation continued with its original design. Finally, the collected NASA TLX data has been processed into the raw TLX scores as suggested from some researchers. 
 
 The below represents the processed TLX scores. To find its statistical differences, the processed data were passed to conducted Wilcoxon-Signed-Rank-Test and the test at its sample size, proved that the given results to be statistically highly significant at (p = 0.005) level. This may imply that the two designed levels of the game were perceived by our potential users to be significantly different where our design then meets our intention.

# Process

## Introduction

The goal for our project was to create a simple visually aesthetic game that gave players a fun yet challenging experience. We aimed to create in one level a replayability factor for the game which would:

- Be a challenging yet engaging experience.
- Have a unique look, prompting the user to explore the map and the game world.
- Create an engaging story, that immerses the user in the game.

To meet these objectives, we adopted the Agile methodology, emphasising:

- Team collaboration with clearly defined roles.
- An iterative testing process.
- Regular feedback from key user groups, including students, teaching assistants, and lecturers.

## Inception

In our initial team meeting, attended by Hamza, GunHo, Yiran, Feng, and Lu, we brainstormed potential game concepts, prioritising personal passion over feasibility. We subsequently narrowed our focus to 2D platformers, dismissing more complex ideas like 3D and online multiplayer games due to time constraints.

**Challenges** during this phase**:**

- Varied coding skills and GitHub familiarity among team members.
- Role assignment.

**Solutions:**

- Each member developed and presented a simple game in Processing, enhancing our understanding of individual coding skills and fostering team cohesion through **pair programming** and feedback.
- We conducted a GitHub tutorial. For example, one of the team members (GunHo) had significantly more GitHub experience than the rest of the team. So we had all team members (Hamza, GunHo, and Yiran present) go through a tutorial on branching, merging, and rebasing. We did this by ‘practice’ codes that we pushed onto git, where each member practised creating their branch, merging code and resolving conflicts.

 **Organisation and Communication**

We decided on a 2D platformer with mechanics similar to those in Super Mario Bros and Flappy Bird, where players could fly by repeatedly pressing a button. Our organisational tools included the Kanban board on GitHub and personal notes on Notion. Unlike traditional Agile methods, we opted for continuous communication via WhatsApp instead of daily stand-ups.

**Challenges:**

- Tasks communicated on WhatsApp were often overlooked and not updated on the Kanban board.

**Solution:**

- As the project manager, I ensured that the Kanban board was regularly updated, facilitated access to meeting spaces, and centralised communication.

Tasks were assigned using a method akin to planning poker, where each member assessed task difficulty before distribution, these sessions also helped us to clarify roles:

- Yiran as the lead developer and coder.
- GunHo as the secondary developer and designer.
- Hamza handling project management and additional coding.

## **Game Development**

Development intensified during reading week and the Easter holiday. An initial minimal viable product was evaluated using Think Aloud and Heuristic evaluation methods, highlighting:

- **Strengths:** Appealing design and intuitive gameplay.
- **Areas for improvement:** Leaderboard integration, flying mechanics, map design, and respawn features.

**Challenges:**

- Uncertainty about game appearance and goals.
- Lack of testers.

**Solution:**
Focusing on a core narrative, we redefined our game around a ghost character collecting pumpkins. We simplified the flying mechanics to better suit the game's aesthetic, transitioning from a flapping to a continuous flight model within a time frame.

During Easter, we held sprint days, refining features and incorporating feedback from friends and family, crucially expanding our tester base to include novice gamers. This feedback led to the implementation of smoother controls and personalised start screens.

**Challenges:**

- Bugs and a scattered focus delayed narrative development.

**Solution:**
We decided against a detailed narrative, opting instead to enhance the gameplay and visual elements. Unimplemented ideas included gameplay mechanics like collecting donuts for extra lives and transforming the ghost into a human.

# Conclusion

Our adherence to Agile practices such as pair programming and iterative testing was instrumental in creating a game that was both enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing. This project underscored the importance of user feedback and continuous iteration, and taught us effective use of tools like Kanban boards and GitHub. These experiences will undoubtedly benefit our future projects.
