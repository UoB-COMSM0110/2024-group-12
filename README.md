Game Idea 1: 

Mario Brothers: 

Overview:
A 2D platform game with jumping and facing game oponents. 

The Twist: 

We decided the twist will be the princess saving mario, with her power being an umbrealla she can use to float between obstacles, giving the game similar game structure as floppy bird. However, the princess will still have the same powers as Mario i.e. 
being able to jump, and having power ups that can increase her size 

The challanages: 

The map will have to be larger than the screen
Physics dynamics associated with jumping to exact location the princess will jump to as well as making sure she stays within the boundries of the map visible to the player
AI mosters / opponents 
Character animations




Game Idea 2: 

Temple Run: 

Overview: 
Similar to 2D platform mario brothers, the screen will follow the player from behind this time as he jumps and ducks

The twist: 

Special power move given to the character, e.g. double jumps (something similar) with the caviat that it is a limited time use, where every time it is used the screen goes darker / smaller making it more difficult to complete the game 


The challanges:

The map will have to be larger than the screen
Physics dynamics associated with jumping to exact location the princess will jump to as well as making sure she stays within the boundries of the map visible to the player
AI mosters / opponents 
Character animations
Perspective movement that allows the camera to follow the player
