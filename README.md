Game Idea 1: 

Mario Brothers: 

Overview:
A 2D platform game with jumping and facing game oponents. 

The Twist: 

We decided the twist will be the princess saving mario, with her power being an umbrealla she can use to float between obstacles, giving the game similar game structure as floppy bird. However, the princess will still have the same powers as Mario i.e. 
being able to jump, and having power ups that can increase her size 

The challanages: 

The map will have to be larger than the screen
Physics dynamics associated with jumping to exact location the princess will jump to as well as making sure she stays within the boundries of the map visible to the player
AI mosters / opponents 
Character animations

Game Idea 2: 

Temple Run: 

Overview: 
Similar to 2D platform mario brothers, the screen will follow the player from behind this time as he jumps and ducks

The twist: 

Special power move given to the character, e.g. double jumps (something similar) with the caviat that it is a limited time use, where every time it is used the screen goes darker / smaller making it more difficult to complete the game 


The challanges:

The map will have to be larger than the screen
Physics dynamics associated with jumping to exact location the princess will jump to as well as making sure she stays within the boundries of the map visible to the player
AI mosters / opponents 
Character animations
Perspective movement that allows the camera to follow the player 


Stake Holders:

End Users/Players: 

The primary stakeholders are the individuals who will be playing the game other team, the teachers, or other friends. The users are the Normal Operators and Purchasers of the game.  

Educational Institutions (teacher): 

As the game is part of an educational goal, the game will be reviewed and tested thus making the educational support staff / Lecturers functional beneficiaries and sponsors of the game. 

Game Developers / Students: 

As the ones developing the game and being tested the students / developers have a direct stake in the gameâ€™s success making us the Maintenance Operators and Operational support.

The interaction of the stake holders with this simple game is designed to be identical so the user specification and user stores can be condensed for all three stake holders identified above. 

User stories

As a gamer, I want to control the characters movements using simple controls that are immediately responsive. These controls should be intuitive controls so that I can navigate through the game easily and enjoy a responsive gaming experience.

As a player of the game, I want a clear objective that provides a rewarding experience, e.g. a method to earn points. 

As a user, I want to unlock special levels or achievements by collecting specific power-ups or achieving certain in-game milestones so that I can explore additional content and challenges.

As a speed runner, I want to have a timer feature to track my completion time for each level so that I can optimize my gameplay and strive for faster completion times.

**Evaluation**


**Think Aloud Evaluation:**

**Tasks**
1. Try and collect as many pumpkins as you can
2. Traverse the game until you reach the finish point
   
Participant1: Feedback

+ The controls were intuative and simple
+ Good Asthetic
+ Jump Speed was set at the right pace - not too large of a jump or small
- Make the background less generic and
- Be able to add player name fully
- No implementation of the "Flappy Bird" component of the game i.e. the donuts were not resolved
- Have a tutorial of the the games functionality and use, what do the pumpkins do? what do the donuts do?

Participant2: Feedback:

+ Good asthetic to the game
- Would like the functionality of respawing where I died rather then the start of the game
- Would like enimes to be chasing the character rather then static obstacles
- Increase the speed to land faster
