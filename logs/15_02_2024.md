Today we discussed User stories and User specifications. And also came up with new refinements to the game.  

Gunho made the kanban board , making organisations easier. As well as, future discussions on how the the git hub commits should be so that everyone is on the same page. 

Yiran made map ideas for the game and hamza and Gunho elaborated the ideas. 

**New Game Ideas:** 

Gunho : 

- Collecting diary pieces (that contains all your secrets) instead of gold coins, the diary pieces range from different values, some really embarrassing ones (that will shine in gold) the user has to collect and some minor ones the user can collect but not essential.

Yiran:

- Falling pieces that the user has to avoid.
